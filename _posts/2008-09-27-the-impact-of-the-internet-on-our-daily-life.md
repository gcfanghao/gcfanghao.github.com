Azalea is having some fun in Maryland. She just took a photo using the iPhone, then sent it to her blog as a [post](http://azaleasays.com/2008/09/27/our-boat-elkworth/) by the app which developed by WordPress.

Two minutes ago, I saw a new message on <strong>MY</strong> <a href="http://friendfeed.com/" target="_blank">FriendFeed</a> page, <a href="http://friendfeed.com/e/3984df66-2865-75ab-ca0c-97b9e16f1c31/Our-boat-Elkworth/" target="_blank">indicating</a> the update of her blog as I just said. Then I clicked the message, redirected to the post and added a <a href="http://azaleasays.com/2008/09/27/our-boat-elkworth/#comment-416" target="_blank">comment</a> .

The whole interaction between us is done within 3 minutes. She shared a photo with all of the visitors of her blog, including me. I left a feedback and got a vivid impression of her journey. We didn't even contact each other directly. This is the impact of the internet on our daily life.

Amazing, isn't it?
